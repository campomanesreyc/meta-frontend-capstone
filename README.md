### Project Overview

The Little Lemon project is designed to allow users to reserve tables at the restaurant through an online interface. Currently, the project consists of a homepage and a reservation page, where users can fill out a form to book their table. The reservation system uses form validation and a calendar for selecting the date.

The project is still in its early stages and will be expanded with additional features and design improvements in future iterations.

### Features

- Users can book a table online through the reservation page.
- Form validation using [**Formik**](https://formik.org/) and [**Yup**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup) libraries.
- Date selection functionality using [**react-calendar**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-calendar).

### Future Plans

- Implement a responsive design to improve accessibility on mobile and tablet devices.
- Expand the project by adding more pages such as the menu page, contact page, and about page.
- Improve user experience and design aesthetics on the homepage and reservation page.

### Technologies Used

- **ReactJS:** Main library used for building the user interface.
- **HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **Formik:** To manage form state and handle validation.
- **Yup:** Used for form validation schemas.
- **react-calendar:** Library for date selection within the reservation form.
